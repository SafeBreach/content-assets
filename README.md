# Cortex XSOAR Content Assets
This repo holds Cortex XSOAR Content Documentation Assets. We store in this repo documentation media assets which are large and we want to keep separate from our main Content repo: https://github.com/demisto/content. Our rule of thumb is to store media assets larger than 2MB in this repo. 

**Note**: Media assets larger than 50MB should be stored using gitlfs.

More info available at our [documentation docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/integration-docs).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome and appreciated. 

Before merging any PRs, we need all contributors to sign a contributor license agreement. By signing a contributor license agreement, we ensure that the community is free to use your contributions.

When you open a new pull request, a bot will evaluate whether you have signed the CLA. If required, the bot will comment on the pull request, including a link to accept the agreement. The CLA document is also available for review as a [PDF](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/master/docs/cla.pdf).

If the `license/cla` status check remains on *Pending*, even though all contributors have accepted the CLA, you can recheck the CLA status by visiting the following link (replace **[PRID]** with the ID of your PR): https://cla-assistant.io/check/demisto/content-assets?pullRequest=[PRID] .
